# Python

On this branch I am working on a foreign exchange/market data tracker.

The program will do the following:
- Show the closed data from 100 of the latest closed positions in a market
- Calculate the changed percentage of the market in the 100 closed positions
- Calculate the changed percentage of the market for every next closed position

This project is being developed to give more insight in the trading markets and to be able to 
apply certain trading stratagies in an automated way.
